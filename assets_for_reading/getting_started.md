Ready to get started? This short paragraph will serve as a brief intro to how to use this optimisation library.

* In construction *

** Optimiser **
The Optimiser class will take in following argument:

    - model: the surrogate model that offers close form solutions and approximate the acquisition fuctions
    - acquisition: the acquisition function that determines the next sampling points
    - n_iter: number of iterations to run the optimisation
    - objective_function: the original black box functions
